    <p>
      In answer to a declining attendance to the arts across the nation, Yodel provides a service that
      makes artistic and cultural events fluid for creatives, accessible to patrons, and profitable for organizations.
      Yodel seeks to reinspire, reconnect, and revolutionize the logistics of artistic interaction.

            <h3 class="h3 col">ISN'T THERE ALREADY AN APP FOR THAT?</h3>
            <p>

          <div class="question">
            <h3 class="h3">WHY DOES YODEL EXIST?</h3>
            <p>
              A lack of awareness, coupled with stiff ticket prices and lengthy travel times are just a few catalysts causing
              the national decline in art and cultural event attendance. Yodel's Comprehensive Artistic Network makes events
              accessible for Patrons, profitable for Organizations, and fulfilling for Creatives.
