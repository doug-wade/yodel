            <h3 class="h3 col">ISN'T THERE ALREADY AN APP FOR THAT?</h3>
            <p>
              Not quite...our competitors certainly try but...our tripartite system is unparalleled in its function & potential.
              It's an innovative, self-sustaining circuit of interaction, deeply rooted in creative connection & cultivating community.
              We are revolutionizing the logistics of artistic interaction.

          <div class="question">
            <h3 class="h3">WHY DOES YODEL EXIST?</h3>
            <p>
              A lack of awareness, coupled with stiff ticket prices and lengthy travel times are just a few catalysts causing
              the national decline in art and cultural event attendance. Yodel's Comprehensive Artistic Network makes events
              accessible for Patrons, profitable for Organizations, and fulfilling for Creatives.
